## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

- What was your motivation? Explore new careers and learn about coding.
- Why did you build this project? To familiarize myself with the material and figure things out on my own.  
- What problem does it solve? It helps with creating an interactive study guide while at the same time learning to code.
- What did you learn? I leanred about the different systems (Git Bash, Git hub, VS Code etc) used in coding.  I also learned about the basic principles for coding.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? The steps required to install my project were to create a git hub account, download git bash, and download VS Code. Git Hub allows me to store all my work in the repository. Git bash allows me to navigate the different folders in git hub and be able to up upload my work.  VS Code was used for code editing and developing. After every change done to the code, the Git Flow process followed. 

## Adding HTML

I used HTML to be able to create <head> and <body> elements, as well as Sections and Child Elements. The following major topics were added as sections - HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript. Notes were added to each section. After this, I followed the Git Flow which was to add, commit, and push my work to the feature branch.  This was followed by a pull request, merge our changes with the main branch, and close the GitHub issue.

## Adding CSS

CSS was used to define the style of the website.  I used external style sheet in order to add styles to HTML elements while keeping my content and styles separate. I also used class attribute to be able to add styles to certain elements but not all elements.  I was able to share a CSS rule to any element by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector, card. Once this waas done, I completed the Git Flow.

## Adding JavaScript

I used JavaScript variable to be able to store a string with a list of prework topics. I also used conditional statements and loops in order to control the order in which code is executed. I also added conditional statements such as if to allow to interrupt control flow. I also incorporated an array and loop. I created a function and added a for loop and if statement.


## Usage

No downloads required. Simply go to the website and read through the different sections.

## Credits

Instructions and samples provided by Prework module.  

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
